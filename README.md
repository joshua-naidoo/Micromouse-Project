# EEE3088F-Micromouse

The Micromouse Project is a project for the EEE3088F students whereby a small robot that looks like a mouse, is required to move through a maze. The EEE3088F students are tasked with designing and implementing the
power board subsystem for the micromouse, with the sensing board, processor board, and motors being provided by the University of Cape Town. The power board should be able to supply current and voltage to the micromouse, utilize a 3.7V LiPo battery, drive motors, and use USB-C as a charging method. The subsystem is designed with performance and reliability in mind, ensuring that the robot can operate in any environment.
